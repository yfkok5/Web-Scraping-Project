# Web-Scraping-Project

## Background
We are here to capture data from both Australia iconic retail company (CatchOfTheDay & Myer), which will be cleaned, compiled and analysed. 

Codes include:

1) Price analysis of sales items
2) No. of Items on sales (based on Brands)
3) Ability to export scrape's data into a csv file

Possible improvements in the future:
1) Panel of all analysis's graph
2) Price comparisons
